# Cat-Dog-Classifier
An image classification project using machine learning to distinguish between cats and dogs. This repository contains code for training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) on a dataset of 25,000 cat and dog images. 

Overview:
Welcome to the Cat-Dog Classification project! This project aims to classify images of cats and dogs using machine learning. The dataset comprises 25,000 images, and we have partially trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, achieving an accuracy of 56%.

How to Use:

(Training from Scratch) -:
1. Download the full dataset from the provided link.
2. Set the path to the downloaded dataset in the code.
3. make sure to (# comment) the last cell titled 'Load & Predict a Pretrained Model' in the notebook.
Run the code to train the model from scratch.

(Using Pretrained Model) -:
1. Download the pretrained model from the provided link (Pretrained Model (56% Accuracy)).
2. (# comment) cells titled 'loading dataset', 'Preprocessing'and 'training model' in the notebook.
3. (# comment) out the last cell titled 'Load & Predict a Pretrained Model'
4. Set the path to the pretrained model in this cell.
Run the code to use the pretrained model for predictions.

Issues and Contributions:
If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue. Contributions are also welcome!

Appreciation:
A heartfelt appreciation to anyone who trains a model with high accuracy and shares it with the community. Your contributions make this project better for everyone!

Acknowledgments:
We would like to extend our gratitude to Kaggle community for their collective efforts in curating and contributing to the Cat-Dog Classification dataset.
This project wouldn't have been possible without the dedicated work of individuals who shared and collaborated on this valuable dataset.

Enjoy classifying cats and dogs with our machine learning model!
